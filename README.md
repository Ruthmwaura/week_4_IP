AUTOLIB ELECTRIC CARS ANALYSIS

In this project we will do a hypothesis test. 


The claim being investigated is that the highest usage of blue cars is on the weekends. This is according to an article written by John Voelcker on ‘Green car Reports’.

**Null hypothesis**: the average number of blue cars taken on weekends is less or equal to that of the blue cars taken on weekdays


**Alternative hypothesis**:the average number of blue cars taken on weekends is greater than that of the blue cars taken on weekdays(CLAIM)
